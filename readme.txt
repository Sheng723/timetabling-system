To run the system, 
First the file needs to be unzip.
Then need to pip install numpy if numpy have not been installed before. 
After that copy the file path and open command prompt. 
Direct to the file path in command prompt and run the code "python main_page.py".

Note: 
The system does not have the function to check the file or data that has been inserted in the database. So if there has been any errors in the data stored in the database, the system will raise error when creating timetable. The timetable created and database created will be named accordingly to the username.
